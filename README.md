# DesktopOS my own Windows 11 iso 

this is a lightweight version of windows made by me with the ntlite config file so if you dont trust the .iso file (which you shouldnt trust files from strangers) if you have ntlite you can make it yourself

it also includes a windows tweak bat file that changes somethings in the registry and improve windows 11 (it also automatically installs winget if for some reason isnt installed by default)

# Terminal Commands
